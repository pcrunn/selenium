# Selenium
Easy to use UI / GUI Framework for Bukkit

I mostly made this because [@crunesmh](https://github.com/crunesmh) deleted his oblique menu api.
I also made a video coding it for some reason and might upload it on youtube sometime.

## How do i use it?
Selenium uses the maven build tool, you can also use it without it though. I provided a guide for using it both with maven or without below.

### Maven:
- Simple, go to your pom.xml and add [add maven repo here when ur bored]

### Without Maven: (not recommended, maven is epic)
- Download or clone the repository
- Take the source code and put it into your project
